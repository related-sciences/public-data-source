## ClinVar Integration

### FTP Archives

Tab delimited archives are available at: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/archive/

See https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/README for a description of the tab delimited file fields.

This is accessible through cross-walks to MedGen.  See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/409/#id_second) for an example (ClinVar Huntington variant).

### Submitters


### RCV

This is found in `variant_summary.txt`.

Definition (from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/identifiers/#rcv): 

> RCV
> Web display
> 'RCV' refers to the first 3 letters of the accession calculated by ClinVar to aggregate information from all submitted records interpreting the same phenotype relative to the same variant or set of variants.  If you submit a query to ClinVar based on an RCV accession, e.g. RCV000009910, you are directed to the page specific to that record. The Assertion and evidence details section of this record lists all the supporting submitted records with their SCV accessions.
